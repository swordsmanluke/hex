# Tasks definition
# A task has the following definitions
#   id: A unique identifier for this task, so you can refer back to it in [[windows]]
#   name: A short human-readable identifier for the task
#   description: A short human-readable description of the task
#   path: The path to run the command in - Ex: "/home/lucas/Software/dark_goggles-0.1/bin"
#   command: The command to run. Ex: "./dark_goggles hourly"
#   period: The time between refreshes. Expects a digit plus an optional unit character.
#           Ex: "10m" for ten minutes. Defaults to seconds if no unit provided

# Layout Definition
#
# Uses 'linearlayout' containers to hold 'textview's.
# Top level is always [layout], which (usually) has kind = "linearlayout" and [[layout.children]] keys.
#
# children have the following definition
#   type: (linearlayout|textview)
#   width: a fixed width in characters. If omitted, will be balanced with other items in container
#   height: a fixed height in characters.           "
#
# linearlayout also defines these keys
#   orientation: (vertical|horizontal) - which way does the layout flow?
#
# textview also defines these keys
#   task_id: Which task should be displayed in this window?
#
# ex:
# [layout]
#   kind = "linearlayout"
#   orientation = "horizontal"
#   [[layout.children]]
#       type = "linearlayout"
#       orientation = "vertical"
#       [[children]]
#           type = "textview"
#           task_id = "some_task"
#           width = 25
#       [[children]]
#           type = "textview"
